Modular Approach with Different Communication Methods:

Pipe-Based Communication:
Pipes are a simple way for communication between a parent and child process.


// Parent process
int fd[2];
pipe(fd);

// Create child process
if (fork() == 0) {
    // Child process
    close(fd[1]);
    // Read from fd[0]
} else {
    // Parent process
    close(fd[0]);
    // Write to fd[1]
}
Named Pipe (FIFO) Communication:
Named pipes (FIFOs) can be used for interprocess communication even between unrelated processes.


mkfifo myfifo
# In one terminal
cat myfifo

# In another terminal
echo "Hello from other terminal" > myfifo
IPC (Inter Process Communication):
Methods like message queues, semaphores, and shared memory can be used for communication.


// Create a message queue
int msgqid = msgget(IPC_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);

// Send and receive messages using msgsnd and msgrcv
File-Based Approach with Signal Passing:
Use files and signals for communication and synchronization.


// In one process
write(fd, "Hello", strlen("Hello"));
kill(pid, SIGUSR1); // Signal to notify the other process

// In another process
read(fd, buffer, buffer_size);
// Signal handler to catch SIGUSR1 and act upon it
Unix Domain Sockets (UDS):
UDS provide a full-duplex communication channel between processes on the same system.


// Create socket
int sockfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Bind and listen (server side)
// Connect (client side)
// Send and receive data
Network Domain Sockets:
Network domain sockets can be used for communication between different machines using IP addresses and ports.

Using Git for Version Control:

Install Git:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

Basic Git Commands:

git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
git clone <repository_url>: Clone a remote repository.
git add <file>: Stage changes for commit.
git commit -m "Commit message": Commit staged changes.
git push: Push local commits to a remote repository.
git pull: Pull changes from a remote repository.
git status: View the status of files in the repository.
Running Programs on Different Laptops and Network Domain Sockets:

You can use network domain sockets (socket with AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM) to communicate between different laptops over a network by specifying IP addresses and ports.
