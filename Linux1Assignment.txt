1.Create user Tom--

sudo adduser tom


2.Modify Tom's shell and password

sudo chsh -s /bin/bash tom
sudo passwd tom


The first command changes Tom's default shell to Bash, and the second command lets you modify Tom's password.

3.Create Directories:

sudo mkdir /project
sudo mkdir /project/linux
sudo mkdir /project/notes
sudo mkdir /project/research

I'm sorry for any confusion, but as a text-based AI, I can't directly interact with your system to create users, folders, and set up permissions. However, I can provide you with the step-by-step instructions on how to achieve this using command-line tools on a Linux system. Please note that these instructions assume you have administrative privileges (root access) on the system.

Create User Tom:

bash
Copy code
sudo adduser tom
Follow the prompts to set a password and any additional user details.

Modify Tom's Shell and Password:

bash
Copy code
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash tom
sudo passwd tom
The first command changes Tom's default shell to Bash, and the second command lets you modify Tom's password.

Create Directories:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir /project
sudo mkdir /project/linux
sudo mkdir /project/notes
sudo mkdir /project/research
Create Groups:

bash
Copy code
sudo addgroup project_group
sudo addgroup friends_group
Add Jane and Tom to Groups:

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG project_group jane
sudo usermod -aG project_group tom
sudo usermod -aG friends_group jane
Set Permissions:

Give read-write-execute permission to the project group for the 'linux' folder:


sudo chown -R jane:project_group /project/linux
sudo chmod -R 770 /project/linux


Give read-write-execute permission to the project group for the 'notes' folder, but restrict others:


sudo chown -R jane:project_group /project/notes
sudo chmod -R 770 /project/notes
sudo chmod -R o-rwx /project/notes


Restrict access to the 'research' folder:


sudo chown -R jane:project_group /project/research
sudo chmod -R 750 /project/research
Create Group-Only File Permissions for 'research' List:
To enable others to see the list of researches without reading the files:


sudo chmod -R g+r /project/research
